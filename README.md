HOWTO:
- drop the html at the root of your SD Card,
- press on "choose file" and browse to the log file you want to inspect,
- press on process file button,
- press on show dive log.

It is a very simple, quick and dirty things, many bugs, if you like it, I am just happy with a nice message,
if not, I will ignore and move on.
If you want to update with a better version, you are more than welcome to participate.

Have a nice day :)
